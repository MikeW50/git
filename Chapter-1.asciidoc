== Let's Fly Some Rockets!

There are three basic kinds of rockets in hobby rocketry, and we're going to start right off by building small examples of each. Part of the reason is to learn some basic concepts before moving on to bigger rockets. Part of the reason is to have some fun with matches, balloons and projectiles.

=== Shopping List

Here's a list of all of the parts you will need to build the rockets in this chapter. All can be found at the local grocery store or variety store. Some are almost certainly lying around the house, so collect those first.

Tools are pretty basic for this chapter. You will need a pair of scissors or some other way to cut paper, such as a hobby knife. A pair of needle-nose pliers is handy but not absolutely necessary.

|Part                   |Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
|Paper matches          |We will use a variety of matches. In some cases, the kind doesn't really matter, but this one is important. Get the cheap paper matches that come in a book where the match tears out of the matchbook. Get at least two books of matches, preferably three or four.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
|Wooden matches         |Here you have some choice. You can get by with paper matches, but you will be holding them for a while. Wooden matches work better. I like the long kitchen matches.

You could also use a fireplace lighter, one of those long gadgets that create a small flame at the end of a metal rod. They are great if you have one, but the wooden matches are a lot cheaper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
|Paper clip             |You will need one or two small metal paper clips. Smaller ones are better for our purpose for reasons we'll see in a moment. Plastic paper clips or paperclips coated in plastic will not work. Thin, stiff metal wire can be used if you have wire cutters and don't mind a little artful bending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
|Paper backed foil      |Here's one item you can't find sitting on the store shelf—or can you? It turns out you can, but this one needs some careful repurposing.

A good choice is the foil from chewing gum, but be careful: most companies are moving away from foil-wrapped gum. One I found that works well is Wrigley's Extra.

I tried lots of foils, and you can, too. One of my favorite failures was the foil used to wrap Hershey's Kisses. The foil was a complete flop, but disposing of the unneeded material wrapped in the foil was quite nice. Remember, experimentation and lab time can be fun. What a great excuse to buy a bag of candy! 
|Sandpaper              |A small piece of fine grit sandpaper. Any old scrap will do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
|Straws                 |Plastic drinking straws are best, but paper will do. Make sure they are fairly large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
|Several sheets of paper|Notebook paper, printer paper, or any other thin paper will do. Construction paper will be too heavy and porous, though—stick with a paper designed for writing or printing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
|Transparent tape       |You will just need a few inches, so grab a roll from last year's Christmas wrapping paper box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
|Modeling clay          |You won't need much—about enough to form two balls the size of the drinking straw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
|Balloons               |A small variety pack with 25 or so balloons is ideal. If you get individual balloons, try to get both round and long balloons, and get several of each. Avoid the balloons intended for twisting into shapes. They are fun for other reasons, but are not thick enough for our purpose. You're looking for a nice, strong balloon.

=== The Match Head Rocket

.An arsenal of match head rockets, waiting for flight.
image::images/Fig%201-20.jpg[]

You'll need these items for your first rocket:

* Paper matches
* Wooden matches or lighter
* Paper clip
* Paper backed foil
* Sandpaper
* Scissors or hobby knife

.Playing with Fire
[WARNING]
=====================================================================
You are literally playing with fire. Like almost everything else in hobby rocketry, that means you need to exercise a bit of common sense. 

This rocket should be built and flown outdoors or in a large room devoid of flammable materials. Take a look around. Is there anything within 5 feet or so that would burn if you held a match under it? If the answer is yes, move it out of the way or pick another location. It's also a good idea to have a hose or fire extinguisher handy.
=====================================================================

Our first rocket is a solid propellant rocket capable of flight up to a few feet, but usually only a foot or two. It's made with a single match head from a paper match and a small piece of paper-backed aluminum foil—a gum wrapper or candy wrapper. The launcher is a bent paper clip, and the igniter is another match or fire starter, preferably a wooden match with a long splinter of wood.

Start by bending the paper clip as shown in <<fig_1_2>>. The long straight part of the wire is the launch rod for the rocket, and the remaining part of the paper clip forms the stand. The angle between the launch rod and ground should be about 45 degrees. Be sure the paper clip is very straight, taking out small kinks by carefully straightening the wire. Needle-nose pliers work well for this.

The rocket is made from foil and a match head. Cut one match head from a paper match, getting as much of the match head and as little of the paper stem as possible. Place this on the paper side of the paper and foil gum wrapper and fold the foil around the launch rail. Pull it off and use a pair of scissors to cut all but about a half-inch of the material away. Slide the rocket back onto the launch rail.

.Slip the rocket onto the launch rail, making sure the fit is fairly loose.
image::images/Fig%201-8.jpg[height="3in"]

The most critical—and difficult—part of building this rocket is to get the foil just tight enough, but not too tight. The rocket needs to slip off of the launch rail effortlessly. If there is any resistance, especially any snagging, the rocket will sit on the pad, trapped on the launch rail, instead of taking flight. Slip it up and down the launch rail to be sure it moves easily. Sand rough edges on the paper clip if necessary.

When you are satisfied with the fit, hold a long wooden match or lighter directly under the bulge in the rocket where the match head is wrapped in foil. In a moment, the match will ignite and…

What, you got a dud? It happens. Even NASA has a few mistakes on their record. If the rocket started to slide but stopped, you likely had a snag on the launcher. Clean the launch rail of any carbon using sandpaper, and check it for rough spots or bends where the rocket might get caught. If the rocket just sat there, it might not have been tight enough on the launch rod. The opening has to be fairly small to form a good nozzle. Set up another rocket and try again. Don't expect a high percentage of successes, though. On some days, I do good to get one successful flight out of ten.

.Can We Use More Power?
****
Did you try two match heads? You might as well get it out of your system now. Go ahead.

In my tests, two match heads were simply too much fuel for a rocket whose combustion chamber was thin foil. The fuel burned through the foil every time. Still, it was worth a try.
****

.Keep All Fingers Intact
[WARNING]
=====================================================================
You might be tempted to take this to the next level. Please don't. Match head rockets are safe and fun, but too many match heads in too strong of a container can create a dangerous explosive.

In particular, do not try to stuff match heads into a CO~2~ cylinder like the kind used for pellet guns. It is disturbingly easy to accidentally ignite a match as it is squeezed through the small metal opening, and the result can be an explosion rather than a rocket motor. According to early accident reports, several people lost fingers or eyes attempting to do just this before prepackaged model rocket motors became available.

Stick to one or, at most, two match heads. Use thin foil. Leave the design and construction of larger rocket motors to people with the proper training and facilities.
=====================================================================

.Theory: Newton's Third Law of Motion
****
Rockets work based on a very simple but often misunderstood principle known as _Newton's Third Law of Motion_. You will see it written many different and equivalent ways. A common way to state it is

    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

So what does that mean?

Imagine for a moment that you are sitting in a boat on a calm lake. You put a shotgun to your shoulder and fire parallel to the water. Either from experience or from movies, you know the shotgun will push back on your shoulder when it fires. The force will also move the boat. It's a simple example of a rocket-propelled boat. By flinging the shotgun pellets and hot gas in one direction, we moved our shoulder and the boat in the other.

.Pellets and gas shot in one direction cause the boat to move in the other.
+Drawing: Shotgun propelled boat.+

Keep in mind that the rocket boat didn't need air or the water to push against. In fact, it's better off without the friction of the air and water.  The whole contraption will move even better in the vacuum of space, where there is no friction from the air or water to slow it down.

Rockets take this idea to an extreme. They push something, usually hot gasses, very very fast on one direction. The rocket itself moves in the other direction, but because it is so much heavier, it moves much more slowly. There is a lot of engineering in making all of this work efficiently. One piece of engineering you saw with the match head rocket was nozzle design. The opening through which the gas is pushed is called the nozzle. If it is too big, the rocket fuel simply burns, just like a match that isn't enclosed at all. If the opening is too small, the gas cannot escape fast enough, and too much pressure builds up inside the rocket motor, causing the motor to rupture. In extreme cases, we call this an explosion. If the nozzle is just right, the rocket propels itself as efficiently as possible with the available rocket fuel.

Newton's Third Law is a basic principle of physics taught in the first few weeks of pretty much any introductory physics course. You won't find a better place to start than an introductory course in physics if you would like to know more about the science behind rocket propulsion.

=== Rocket Balloons

.Up, up and away!
image::images/Fig%201-21.jpg[]

Here's what you will need for your second rocket:

* Balloons
* Writing or copying paper
* Scissors or hobby knife

At some point, anyone who plays with balloons blows one up and lets it go. It's a perfect example of a simple rocket. Air is pushed out one end of the balloon, and the balloon itself is pushed in the opposite direction. Go ahead—give it a try.

Well, the balloon may move, but there is very little direction in the flight. It tends to twirl around randomly. See the theory section to find out why.

.Theory: Rocket Stability
****
Take a pencil and spin it on the table. The point it spins around is called the center of gravity. If the pencil's density is the same along the entire length, it's the location on the pencil where there is an equal amount of weight on either side of the point the pencil is spinning around, which will be halfway between the end points. It's a bit more complicated for objects that have some spots that are heavier than others, a topic we'll return to later in the book.

+verify we do this, then provide a cross-reference.+

The point is the same if you toss the pencil into the air, and the same idea applies to the balloon: A spinning object always spins around its center of gravity unless there is some force throwing it off balance.

.Objects spin around their center of gravity unless there is an outside force.
+Drawing: Pencil spinning about its center of gravity+

Now imagine a weather vane for a moment. You can even make one from a pencil by attaching a piece of paper to one end and poking a pin through the center of gravity. When the wind blows from the side, there is more force on the side with the paper vane than the side that just has the pencil, so the pencil spins around until the vane points away from the wind. You could, of course, move the pin back to a point where the force from the wind was the same on either side of the pin, and the pencil would no longer spin in the wind. That point is called the center of pressure.

.Objects spin in the wind unless the point they turn around is at the center of pressure.
+Drawing: Pencil weather vane with wind motion indicated, pin and CP showing no turning.+

Putting these two ideas together gives the classic design for a rocket. The center of pressure is about halfway down the body of the rocket, but the fins near the base of the rocket put the center of pressure well behind the center of gravity. If the rocket starts to spin for some reason—a gust of wind or a slightly off-center thrust from the rocket motor—the fins act to keep it flying straight.

.Objects spin in the wind unless the point they turn around is at the center of pressure.
+Drawing: Rocket with the center of pressure and center of gravity marked.+

The skeptics in the crowd may note that NASAs rockets don't all have fins, and they would be right. Some, like the Mercury Redstone that carried the first American astronaut Alan Shepherd into space, did have fins for guidance, but others, like the Mercury Atlas that carried John Glenn into orbit, did not. Still others, like the Vostok 1 that carried the first human, Russia's Yuri Gagarin, into space have tiny fins.

.Some rockets don't have fins. They use active guidance instead. From left to right, the Mercury Redstone has fins, the Mercury Atlas does not, and the Vostok 1 has very small fins.

All of these rockets, though, used active guidance. Computers and gyroscopes monitor the flight of the rocket, redirecting the thrust of the rocket motor to keep the rocket flying straight. Our simpler rockets use fins instead of active guidance.

We'll see later that all of our rockets must have the center of pressure behind the center of gravity by at least the diameter of the body tube, and look at ways to change our rocket designs to make this happen.
****

We'll need to add something to our balloon to stabilize it. Fins are a little impractical, but a sheet of paper will do nicely. Take a look at <<fig_1_12>>, which shows our balloon rocket with a guidance system attached.

Cut a square piece of paper about the diameter of a long balloon or 2/3 the diameter of a round balloon. Fold it corner to corner twice to give it some form, then trim out a small opening in the center where the folds intersect. Make the hole just big enough for the neck of the balloon without pinching off the air flow.

Fold the paper as much as possible to form a more fin-like shape. You won't be able to make it perfect because you need room to blow up the balloon.

If all goes well, the rocket will power across the room flying a lot straighter than before, although definitely not perfectly straight. These are fairly crude fins, after all.

If the rocket is still very unstable, increase the size of the paper. If it is very slow or can't lift itself at all, reduce the size of the paper. The balloon can wear out, too. If the balloon doesn't shrink back to roughly its original size, or gets very easy to blow up, it won't have as much power. Switch to a new balloon and try again.

The idea of using pressurized air to power a rocket is something you will see again later in the book. A plastic soda bottle will replace the balloon, a bicycle pump or compressor will replace blowing up the balloon, and we will use water rather than air as a propellant, but the idea is exactly the same.

.Exploration
****
. Try long and round balloons. Which works better?
. Try large and small balloons. Again, which works better?
. How many times can the balloon be used before it looses too much thrust?
. Can you come up with a design that has better fins?
. Build a boat from a small piece of wood or Styrofoam and design a rocket propulsion system for it using a balloon for power.
. Why not use water? Add a small amount of water to the balloon, and then launch it vertically so the water is at the bottom and gets pushed out by the air. Does it work? Why?

=== Air Rockets

.Colorful air rockets.

You will need these items for an air rocket:

* A straw
* Paper
* Tape
* Clay
* Scissors or hobby knife

Air rockets still use Newton's Third Law, but unlike the match head rocket or the balloon rocket, an air rocket doesn't carry the propellant along with it. In this case, the rocket is a projectile, and is expelled from the launcher with a blast of air.

The straw is the launcher, and doesn’t need any preparation.

Create a tube for the rocket from a strip of paper about 4 inches long and about as wide as four straw diameters. A sheet of plain paper works well, but Origami paper makes a fun and colorful substitute. The straw I used is about 3/16 inch in diameter, so the width of the paper strip was 12/16 inch, or ¾ inch. See, fractions really are useful, no matter what the big kids said in second grade.

Wrap the paper around the straw, making it as snug as you can while still letting it slide easily along the straw. Use two small pieces of tape about one inch from each end to secure the paper while you add a final piece of tape the entire length of the paper tube.

Using a long piece of tape, create three fins about and inch long at one end of the rocket. Use scissors to trim them to a fun shape. The fins push the center of pressure back towards the base of the rocket. See the Theory: Rocket Stability section to see why this is important.

.Form fins from tape.

Use a small piece of clay to form a nose cone. It needs to block the end of the tube. Streamlining isn't terribly important at this point, but will definitely add to the cool factor for the rocket.

.The completed air rocket.

It's time for the maiden voyage. Despite its simplicity, this air rocket will perform better than the match head or balloon rockets, easily flying 10 to 15 feet. Slip the rocket onto the straw, aim it a little below 45 degrees from the horizontal for a really long flight, and give a sharp puff into the straw.

Air rockets are a simple and inexpensive way to explore rocketry. We'll come back to them, building much more powerful versions, in Chapter +?+.

.Theory: Is an Air Rocket Really a Rocket?
****
A purist might object that an air rocket really isn't a rocket at all, since it doesn't carry along its own fuel or expel something for propulsion.

I tend to get caught in those ivory towers, too. Come down for a moment, and consider that this is a book about rocket science using hobby rocketry. Many of the principles of rocket flight, like stability, apply just as much to air rockets as chemical or water rockets. Also, not all serious rocket science uses classical rocket propulsion. Consider the mass driver as just one example. The NASA concept is a rail gun, generally envisioned as a way to launch material from the Moon for pickup by an orbiting platform. It uses electricity rather than air, but like the air rocket, the energy is provided at launch, not during flight.

Besides, air rockets are fun!
